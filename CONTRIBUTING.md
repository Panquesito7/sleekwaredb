Since GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you to include most information possible.

You can see **[issues](https://github.com/SleekwareDB/sleekwaredb/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

## Commit Message Guidelines üòé

In order to make git commit messages easier to read and faster to reason about, we follow some guidelines on most commits to keep the format predictable. Check [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for more information about our guidelines.

**Examples**:
```

docs: add API documentation to the bot
test(server): add cache tests to the movie resource
fix(web): add validation to phone input field
fix(web): remove avatar image from being required in form

```

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

## How to Contribute üöÄ

- Please create an [issue](issues) before creating a pull request.
- Fork the repository and create a branch for any issue that you are working on.
- Create a pull request which will be reviewed and suggestions would be provided.
- Add Screenshots to help us know what changes you have done.

## How to make a pull request ü§î

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/SleekwareDB/sleekwaredb) repository.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sleekwaredb.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd sleekwaredb
```

**4.** Create a new branch

Kindly give your branch a more descriptive name like `feat-add-ethereum` instead of `patch-1`.

You could follow this convention. Some ideas to get you started:

- Feature Updates: `feat-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- Bug Fixes: `fix-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- Documentation: `docs-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- And so on...

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

**5.** Add the resource, please follow the guidelines following

- Add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
  - Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Don't mention `Web3` in the description as it's implied.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove any trailing whitespace.

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**

**6.** Stage your changes and commit.

```bash
git add . # Stages all the changes
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

[**Follow our commit guide from above**](#style-guide-for-git-commit-messages-)

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

**8.** Create a new [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from `your-branch-name`

**9.** üéâ Congratulations! You've made your first pull request! Now, you should just wait until the maintainers review your pull request.

## üõë Important

### ‚úÖ Good Practice

- Comment on the issue to get assigned
- Create an issue before you make a Pull Request

### ‚ùå Bad Practice

- Creating PRs without assignment will not be accepted and will be closed.
